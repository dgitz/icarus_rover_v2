{\ttfamily M\+A\+V\+Link\+Tests} target covers {\ttfamily Data\+Extensions} with unit tests (conversion between raw data and typed values). Also it contains some integration tests for {\ttfamily M\+A\+V\+Link} class.

To quickly generate M\+A\+V\+Link classes and enums for Swift you can use following script\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
./ardugen.sh
\end{DoxyCode}
 It will generate Swift files for {\ttfamily ardupilotmega.\+xml} definitions into {\ttfamily M\+A\+V\+Link/\+M\+A\+V\+Link/\+Swift} folder and C headers for the same xml file into {\ttfamily M\+A\+V\+Link\+Test/\+M\+A\+V\+Link/C} folder. C headers are used to check Swift library compatibility with C/\+C++ implementations.

Please keep in mind that you will probably need to re-\/add generated M\+A\+V\+Link swift files to the project as complete list of files depends on specific declarations in xml file. C headers will be compiled as Clang module, so there is no need to add them into Xcode project.

Test suite consists of\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Data\+Extensions\+Tests.\+swift} contains unit tests that cover raw-\/to-\/typed values transformations and vise versa (with informative erroring)
\item {\ttfamily M\+A\+V\+Link\+Tests.\+swift} covers some edge cases of parsing state machine
\item {\ttfamily Compare\+With\+C\+Imp\+Tests.\+swift} tests which compare output of Swift library with C on the same raw data input (attached tlog file)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Test tlog file was downloaded from \href{https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-la-testdata}{\tt Drone\+Kit LA testdata} repository.
